== Architecture

The user Interface is a web app written in Javascript using Ionic and is rendered within a WebView. The business logic and data model is written in native Swift.
The data model uses Couchbase Lite as the embedded data persistence layer.
The https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html[Cordova Plugin API] acts as the bridging layer between the JavaScript and the native Swift worlds . The plugin exposes a Javascript API to the web app.

This architecture allows you to write the User Interface code once for both iOS and Android apps while leveraging Couchbase Lite's native iOS framework for data management.

== Data Model

The data model for the app is very straightforward.
There is one type of document:
the _"hotel"_ document which contains the details of each hotel.
Those documents have a `"type": "hotel"` property.
