In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Couchbase Lite in a Cordova application.

The sample project is a Cordova web application that allows users to query for and display a list of hotels stored in a Couchbase Lite database.

== Architecture

The user Interface is a web app written in Javascript using Ionic and is rendered within a WebView. The business logic and data model is written in native Java.
The data model uses Couchbase Lite as the embedded data persistence layer.
The https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html[Cordova Plugin API] acts as the bridging layer between the JavaScript and the native Java worlds . The plugin exposes a Javascript API to the web app.

This architecture allows you to write the User Interface code once for both iOS and Android apps while leveraging Couchbase Lite's native Android framework for data management.

== Data Model

The data model for the app is very straightforward.
There is one type of document:
the _"hotel"_ document which contains the details of each hotel.
Those documents have a `"type": "hotel"` property.

== Pre-requisites

This tutorial requires the following components and versions to run successfully.

* Android Studio 3.0 or above
* Android SDK 19 or above
* Couchbase Lite 2.1.0 and above

The tutorial also assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of developing apps with Cordova and Java.

== Getting Started

*The User Interface has already been implemented in the starter project.
You will add the code to persist and query data.*

. Install the Ionic and Cordova CLIs which are tools that are required for building and managing Ionic and Cordova based apps.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install -g ionic cordova
----
. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/starter-project.zip[starter project].
. Unzip *starter-project.zip*.
. Open the *starter-project/* directory in the JavaScript editor of your choice (for example, https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] or https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm]).
. The User Interface code is located in *HotelLister/src/pages/home/*.
. Run the following commands in your Terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelLister
npm install
----
The `npm install` command installs dependencies.
. To deploy the app to an Android emulator, run the following.
+
[source,bash]
----
ionic cordova run android
----
NOTE: If you get the following error message "Could not find an installed version of Gradle either in Android Studio, or on your system to install the gradle wrapper." you can install Gradle using Homebrew with `brew install gradle`.
. You should see an empty list view as shown below.
+

In the next section, you will setup the Cordova plugin which is the first step for establishing communication between native code and JavaScript.

== Cordova Plugin Setup

With https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html[Cordova Plugins], you can write native code and have access to it from JavaScript.
Plugins provide access to device and platform functionality that is ordinarily unavailable to web-based apps.

In this section you will create a new plugin called *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister* to implement data persistence using Couchbase Lite's Java API.

The plugin code will be added to the *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister* folder which resides alongside the *HotelLister* folder.

The starter project contains a file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/src/android/Utils.java* that will be used in a later section to unzip the pre-built database.

. Create a new file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/plugin.xml* with the following.
+
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plugin xmlns="http://apache.org/cordova/ns/plugins/1.0"
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        id="cordova-plugin-hotel-lister" version="0.0.1">
  <name>cordova-plugin-hotel-lister</name>
  <description>An Cordova plugin for the Hotel Lister application to implement data persistence using Couchbase Lite.</description>
  <license>Couchbase CE / https://www.couchbase.com/binaries/content/assets/website/legal/ce-license-agreement.pdf</license>

  <engines>
    <engine name="cordova" version=">=3.0.0"/>
  </engines>

  <js-module src="www/hotel-lister.js" name="HotelLister">
    <clobbers target="window.plugins.HotelLister" />
  </js-module>

  <platform name="android">
    <config-file target="res/xml/config.xml" parent="/*">
      <feature name="HotelLister">
        <param name="android-package" value="com.hotellister.HotelLister"/>
      </feature>
    </config-file>

    <source-file
            src="src/android/HotelLister.java"
            target-dir="src/com/hotellister/" />
    <source-file
            src="src/android/Utils.java"
            target-dir="src/com/hotellister/" />
  </platform>
</plugin>
----
* The `id="cordova-plugin-hotel-lister"` attribute is the plugin name which will be used later to import it in the Ionic project.
* The `<js-module></js-module>` XML tag declares the location of the file that will declare the JavaScript interface.
* The `<platform name="android"></platform>` XML tag declares the location of the Java files to hold the native code.
. Create a new file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/package.json* with the following.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{package-json}[indent=0]
----
This file describes the plugin.
. Create a new file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/www/hotel-lister.js*.
This file defines the JS API with which a Cordova/Ionic web app may interact with this plugin.
Generally, this means that the plugin binds to the window element and by doing so, grants access to its parent project through simple JavaScript references.
Add the following to your *hotel-lister.js* file:
+
[source,javascript]
----
var exec = require('cordova/exec');

var hotelLister = {
  /* code will be added here later */
};

module.exports = hotelLister;
----
. Create a new file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/src/android/HotelLister.java* with the following. This file provides the native Java implementation corresponding to the APIs defined in *hotel-lister.js*.
+
[source,java]
----
public class HotelLister extends CordovaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void initialize(CordovaInterface cordova, CordovaWebView webView) {
        super.initialize(cordova, webView);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, final CallbackContext callbackContext) {
        return false;
    }

}
----
. To verify that your plugin is ready to work as expected, you have to install it in your *HotelLister* project.
To do so, run the following commands from the root of the *starter-project* folder.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelLister
cordova plugin add ../cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/
----
If successful, you should the following output.
+
[source,bash]
----
Adding cordova-plugin-hotel-lister to package.json
Saved plugin info for "cordova-plugin-hotel-lister" to config.xml
----

== Couchbase Lite Setup

Add the following in the `dependencies` section of *HotelLister/platforms/android/app/build.gradle*.

[source,java]
----
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
    // SUB-PROJECT DEPENDENCIES START
    implementation(project(path: ":CordovaLib"))
    compile "com.android.support:support-annotations:27.+"
    // SUB-PROJECT DEPENDENCIES END
    implementation 'com.couchbase.lite:couchbase-lite-android:2.1.0'
}
----

== Database Setup

In our example, we will start with a pre-built Couchbase Lite database that contains a bunch of hotel documents.
We will make our queries against the documents in this database.
Note that in a real world application, the data could be synced down from other Couchbase Lite clients or from Sync Gateway in the cloud.

The pre-built database needs to be added to the Android Studio project.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/travel-sample.cblite2.zip[travel-sample.cblite2.zip] and drag it over to *HotelLister/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/*.
. We will use the singleton pattern to setup the database instance.
Create a new file at *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/src/android/DatabaseManager.java* and insert the following.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{databasemanager-java}[tag=setup-database,indent=0]
----
+
You first check if a database named "travel-sample" exists.
If it doesn't exist, *the travel-sample.cblite2* database file that was bundled with the app is copied to the default Couchbase Lite directory.
The database is then opened and the database instance is set.
+
. When adding a new Java file, it must be referenced in the plugin's configuration file.
Insert the following as a child to the `<platform name="android"></platform>` element in *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/plugin.xml*.
+
[source,xml]
----
<source-file
        src="src/android/DatabaseManager.java"
        target-dir="src/com/hotellister/" />
----
. Next, add the following instance variable in *HotelLister.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
private Database database;
----
. Then, update the `initialize` method in *HotelLister.java* with the following to set the `database` instance property.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{hotelfinderjava-platform}[tag=initialize,indent=0]
----
. To test your changes, you must re-install the Cordova plugin from *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister* to *HotelLister*.
Run the following commands from the root of the *starter-project* folder.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelLister
cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-hotel-lister
cordova plugin add ../cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/
----
. Build the project.
+
[source,bash]
----
ionic cordova run android
----
The application should run successfully.

In the next section, you will use this Database variable to query hotels from the pre-built database.

== Listing Hotels

In this section, you will add the functionality to list hotels from the database.

. Insert a new method called `queryHotels` in *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/src/android/HotelLister.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{hotelfinderjava-platform}[tag=query-hotels,indent=0]
----
This code queries documents where the `type` property is `hotel`.
. You can now call this method from the `execute` method in *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/src/android/HotelLister.java*.
+
Whatever is dispatched to the plugin with JavaScript's exec function is passed into the plugin class's execute method.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{hotelfinderjava-platform}[tag=execute,indent=0]
----
. Next, you will update the plugin's JavaScript interface. In *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/www/hotel-lister.js*, replace `/* code will be added here later */` with the following.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{hotelfinderplugin}[tag=query-hotels,indent=0]
----
. You can now call the `queryHotels` method in the Ionic project.
Add the following to the `constructor` method in *HotelLister/src/pages/home/home.ts*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{home-ts}[tag=query-hotels,indent=0]
----
. To test your changes, you must re-install the Cordova plugin from *cordova-plugin-hotel-lister* to *HotelLister*.
Run the following commands from the root of the *start-project* folder
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelLister
cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-hotel-lister
cordova plugin add ../cordova-plugin-hotel-lister/
----
. Build and run.
+
[source,bash]
----
ionic cordova run android
----
. You should now see the list of hotels.
+
